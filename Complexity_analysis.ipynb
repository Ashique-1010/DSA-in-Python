By understanding the time and space complexities, we can predict how algorithms will perform as input sizes grow, allocate resources efficiently, compare different algorithms solving the same problem, and identify areas for optimization. This knowledge is crucial for designing scalable and performant software systems, making informed decisions about algorithm selection, and developing problem-solving skills in computer science education."
